    - My name is Apple Kimberly M. Calvario
    \n\nTell me something about you.
    - I am 21 years old, and an irregular student, I shift course from BEED to BSIT because I don\t see myself being a teacher in the future. It was my mother\s dream for me but I chose to follow the path of my own. I believe there will be a time where I have to decide for myself, and I didn\t regret doing it.
    \n\nTell me about your strengths.
    - I don\t give up easily, which makes me a strong person cause no matter what obstacle I face, i always try to find a way to face it. I can also be a risk taker, I am not afraid to try new things and gain experiences that will be beneficial for me in the future.
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me what inspires you.
        - Successful people who don't look aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadown on others and instead help them grow always inspires me. Also my family and people who support me. Now that I am working as a student assistant, the people i encounter at work also motivates and inspires me to do my best everyday.
